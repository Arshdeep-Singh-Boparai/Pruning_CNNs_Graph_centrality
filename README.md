# Pruning_CNNs_using_Graph_centrality)_methods [To be updated soon]


This repo contains code for our paper: Compressing Audio CNNs usign Graph Centrality based Filter Pruning [1]. 


## Pruning_methods.py

Python script to compute important indexes of filters in a given layer using various methods including graph-based centrality methods, cosine-similaity methods, HRank, Energy-aware mehtods. For more detials, please see [1].
